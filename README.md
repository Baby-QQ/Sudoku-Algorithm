# Sudoku-Algorithm
This research topic comes from an experiment of algorithm course: 
    using the backtracking method to solve the Sudoku, using the backtracking method to try the number of each cell in the initial board of Sudoku, recursively, until the Sudoku is completed.It can be seen that the implementation efficiency of the algorithm is not high. Therefore, if the computer can observe the Sudoku problem and solve it just like human beings, that is, combining the manual method with the computing speed of the computer, the efficiency of the whole program will be greatly improved.For manual solution methods, roughly includes 7 kinds, how to make these methods to call each other, how to let the computer to realize these methods, how to let the computer understand when to use what method......All these questions are the key points of this research.
    
    There is no specific reference and data for the algorithm implementation, so I can only rely on personal ideas to write the implementation process of the algorithm, and continue to optimize, so as to achieve a higher operational efficiency.The specific use of C++ language and data structure knowledge to achieve.By comparing the running time of solving the same sudoku problem to determine the pure backtracking method and the backtracking method combining artificial strategy, the comparison of the advantages of the two algorithms to draw a conclusion.The Sudoku questions come from a large number of 9*9 Sudoku questions on the Internet at various levels of difficulty.By comparing the experimental results of the program, the efficiency of integrating manual strategy is 41 times higher than that of backtracking method. For Sudoku with low difficulty level such as Easy and Simple, the time of solving manual strategy is about 0.2ms, while the time of backtracking method is about 122ms, the efficiency is significantly improved.For the difficult sudoku such as Intermediate and Expert, the average time of manual solving strategy is about 2ms, while the backtracking method needs 80ms. Similarly, the improvement of efficiency is also very significant.Even if there are some special sudoku, make artificial solution strategy algorithm also not very efficient, but it looked like sudoku subject collected 10000 online sudoku in the title has not yet found, only in sudoku site collected 1 case of extreme series alone, therefore, illustrate the efficiency of artificial solution strategy algorithm almost entirely over the backtracking method.
    
    Therefore, it can be concluded that for the vast majority of Sudoku, the manual method is much more efficient than the backtracking method alone.
